# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for house prices using linear regression. The model will be trained on a dataset containing information about house features such as size, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built. The goal is to accurately predict house prices to assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

## Data Acquisition

- Obtain a dataset containing information about house prices and relevant features such as size, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built. Ensure that the dataset has a sufficient number of samples for meaningful analysis.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and summary statistics.
- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., by imputation or removal).
- Examine the distribution of numerical variables and consider normalization or transformation if necessary.
- Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (house prices) using scatter plots, histograms, or correlation matrices.

## Model Building

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- Train a linear regression model using the training data. Use features such as size, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built to predict house prices.
- Assess the model's performance on the training set using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).
- Tune the model if necessary by experimenting with different feature combinations or regularization techniques.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its generalization performance.
- Calculate performance metrics such as MSE and RMSE on the testing set to quantify the model's predictive accuracy.
- Visualize the predicted house prices versus the actual prices to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

- Summarize the findings from the analysis, including the model's performance and any insights gained into the factors influencing house prices.
- Provide recommendations to stakeholders based on the model's predictions, such as pricing strategies or investment opportunities.
- Discuss potential areas for further improvement or expansion of the predictive model.

## Documentation and Presentation

- Document the entire project, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model architecture, and evaluation results.
- Prepare a presentation or report summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
- Communicate the results effectively to stakeholders, highlighting the value of the predictive model in real estate decision-making.
